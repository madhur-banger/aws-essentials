            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project showcases the development of a fully serverless web application using AWS services. The core
                idea is to implement a serverless architecture where the backend logic, data storage, and static content
                hosting are managed by AWS services, enabling scalability, cost efficiency, and minimal infrastructure
                management.</p>
            <p>With this project, you can understand how AWS services can be leveraged to build modern web applications that
                are both robust and scalable. The primary services involved in this architecture are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> Executes backend logic without the need for provisioning or managing servers.
                    Lambda functions run your code in response to events and automatically manage the compute resources,
                    scaling up or down as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon DynamoDB:</strong> A fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and
                    predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB is used for storing and managing
                    application data with high availability and durability.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon S3:</strong> Simple Storage Service (S3) provides scalable object storage for static
                    content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files. It is used to host the frontend assets of the
                    web application.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon CloudFront:</strong> A content delivery network (CDN) that distributes content globally,
                    reducing latency and improving the performance of web applications by caching static assets at edge
                    locations close to the user.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
            <p>The architecture leverages the following AWS services to build a robust, scalable, and highly available
                application:</p>
            <img src="Architecture.png" alt="Architecture Diagram" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p>The architecture consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> Handles the backend logic, processing requests and interacting with
                    DynamoDB. Lambda functions are triggered by API Gateway or other events and perform CRUD operations on
                    the database.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon DynamoDB:</strong> Stores all application data, such as user information and other
                    necessary data for the application. It provides fast and flexible data access, supporting key-value
                    and document data structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon S3:</strong> Hosts the static assets of the application. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                    files are stored in an S3 bucket and served to users when they access the web application.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon CloudFront:</strong> Distributes the content from the S3 bucket to users worldwide,
                    caching the static assets and reducing the load times of the application.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Project Workflow</h2>
            <p>The project is divided into several key stages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Create and configure a DynamoDB table:</strong> Start by defining the schema for the data you
                    need to store. Configure the table's primary key and set up any necessary secondary indexes to
                    support querying requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop AWS Lambda functions:</strong> Create Lambda functions to perform CRUD operations on the
                    DynamoDB table. Each function will handle different aspects of the backend logic, such as creating,
                    reading, updating, or deleting data.</li>
                <li><strong>Host frontend assets on S3:</strong> Upload the static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to an S3
                    bucket configured for static website hosting. Ensure the appropriate permissions and bucket policies are
                    set to allow public access.</li>
                <li><strong>Set up CloudFront:</strong> Configure a CloudFront distribution to cache and deliver the static
                    content from the S3 bucket. This improves the performance and availability of your web application by
                    reducing latency and providing global content delivery.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Serverless app leveraging AWS services:</strong> By completing this project, you will have
                    built a fully serverless web application that utilizes AWS services for backend logic, data storage,
                    and content delivery.</li>
                <li><strong>Hands-on experience with Lambda and DynamoDB:</strong> You will gain practical experience in
                    developing and deploying Lambda functions and working with DynamoDB for data management.</li>
