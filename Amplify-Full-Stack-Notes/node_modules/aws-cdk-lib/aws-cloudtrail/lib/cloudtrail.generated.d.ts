         * - *`eventSource`* - This field is only used for management events and network activity events.
         *
         * For management events, this is an optional field that can be set to `NotEquals` `kms.amazonaws.com` to exclude KMS management events, or `NotEquals` `rdsdata.amazonaws.com` to exclude RDS management events.
         *
         * For network activity events, this is a required field that only uses the `Equals` operator. Set this field to the event source for which you want to log network activity events.

         * - *`eventName`* - This is an optional field that is only used for data events and network activity events. You can use any operator with `eventName` . You can use it to ﬁlter in or ﬁlter out specific events. You can have multiple values for this ﬁeld, separated by commas.
         * - *`eventCategory`* - This field is required and must be set to `Equals` .
         *
         * - For CloudTrail management events, the value must be `Management` .
         * - For CloudTrail data events, the value must be `Data` .

         *
         * The following are used only for event data stores:
         *
         * - For CloudTrail Insights events, the value must be `Insight` .
         * - For AWS Config configuration items, the value must be `ConfigurationItem` .
         * - For Audit Manager evidence, the value must be `Evidence` .
         * - For non- AWS events, the value must be `ActivityAuditLog` .
         * - *`errorCode`* - This ﬁeld is only used to filter CloudTrail network activity events and is optional. This is the error code to filter on. Currently, the only valid `errorCode` is `VpceAccessDenied` . `errorCode` can only use the `Equals` operator.
         * - *`resources.type`* - This ﬁeld is required for CloudTrail data events. `resources.type` can only use the `Equals` operator.
         *
         * For a list of available resource types for data events, see [Data events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-data-events) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .
         *
         * You can have only one `resources.type` ﬁeld per selector. To log events on more than one resource type, add another selector.
         * - *`resources.ARN`* - The `resources.ARN` is an optional field for data events. You can use any operator with `resources.ARN` , but if you use `Equals` or `NotEquals` , the value must exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type you've speciﬁed in the template as the value of resources.type. To log all data events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use the `StartsWith` operator, and include only the bucket ARN as the matching value.

     *
     * The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of AWS Lambda data events for a Lambda function named *MyLambdaFunction* , but not for all Lambda functions.
     *
     * - A user runs a script that includes a call to the *MyLambdaFunction* function and the *MyOtherLambdaFunction* function.
     * - The `Invoke` API operation on *MyLambdaFunction* is an Lambda API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified logging data events for *MyLambdaFunction* , any invocations of that function are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.
     * - The `Invoke` API operation on *MyOtherLambdaFunction* is an Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data events for all Lambda functions, the `Invoke` operation for *MyOtherLambdaFunction* does not match the function specified for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.

         *
         * For management events, this is an optional field that can be set to `NotEquals` `kms.amazonaws.com` to exclude KMS management events, or `NotEquals` `rdsdata.amazonaws.com` to exclude RDS management events.

         * - *`eventCategory`* - This field is required and must be set to `Equals` .

         *
         * The following are used only for event data stores:
         *
         * - For CloudTrail Insights events, the value must be `Insight` .

         * - *`errorCode`* - This ﬁeld is only used to filter CloudTrail network activity events and is optional. This is the error code to filter on. Currently, the only valid `errorCode` is `VpceAccessDenied` . `errorCode` can only use the `Equals` operator.
         * - *`resources.type`* - This ﬁeld is required for CloudTrail data events. `resources.type` can only use the `Equals` operator.
         *
         * For a list of available resource types for data events, see [Data events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-data-events) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide* .
         *
         * You can have only one `resources.type` ﬁeld per selector. To log events on more than one resource type, add another selector.
         * - *`resources.ARN`* - The `resources.ARN` is an optional field for data events. You can use any operator with `resources.ARN` , but if you use `Equals` or `NotEquals` , the value must exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type you've speciﬁed in the template as the value of resources.type. To log all data events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use the `StartsWith` operator, and include only the bucket ARN as the matching value.
